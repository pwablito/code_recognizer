# Code Recognizer
An Application for recognizing programming languages

This application uses Apple's CoreML for its ML model.

It is currently trained on samples of my code, most of which can probably be found on my GitHub account. It currently recognizes the following:

- Rust
- Go
- CSS
- HTML
- JavaScript
- C
- Python
- Swift
